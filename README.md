# Python List Operations

This script demonstrates basic list operations in Python, such as appending, inserting, extending, sorting, and indexing.

## How It Works
- Creates an empty list.
- Appends numbers: `10, 20, 30, 40`.
- Inserts `15` at the second position.
- Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
- Removes the last element.
- Sorts the list in ascending order.
- Finds and prints the index of `30`.
